## Getting Started

First, we need to populate the .env file with the following variables:

```bash

NEXT_PUBLIC_FORU_MS_API_URL="http://localhost:7071/api" # The backend URL can be gotten by following the instructions of the readme in the backend repository
```

[Backend repository](https://github.com/Abdulrahman-Al-Hasbani-UCLL/CloudNativeApp_Backend.git)


## Running locally

First, run the development server, use npm, yarn, pnpm or even bun:

```bash
# First install the dependancies
npm install

# Then
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to view the app.
